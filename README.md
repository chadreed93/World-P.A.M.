# World-P.A.M.
World P.A.M. is a Python-based geopolitical and global-risk analysis tool that digests live international news feeds (Reuters, BBC, AP, UN, NATO, IAEA, Al Jazeera, DW News, etc.) and generates probabilistic forecasts for world events — from global war risk to civil unrest, nuclear use, government collapse, economic crisis, pandemics, and more.
